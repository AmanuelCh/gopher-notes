# Requirements

Take a look at the ideas below to get the most out of this guide. If you're familiar with Go, ignore this section and read the topic of your choice.

## Don't skip the basics

If it's your first time learning Go, don't skip the basics of the language like variables and types, functions, structs and so. You can then jump around the topics and refer to the guide as per your interest.

## Do the exercises

This one is an important one. Your learning is tested by doing the exercises provided. Navigate to the [exercises section](/exercises) and try to solve as many exercises as possible. Plus, consider doing challenges on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) or other similar platforms.

## Read the **"wrapping up"** sections

Each topic has a **"wrapping up"** section where you can get a glimpse of what was covered and analyze the pieces quickly. Even if you skipped a specific topic, you can read the wrapping up section to get familiar with the topic.

## Make sure to understand the code snippet

While following the guide, you might come across lots of code snippets. Make sure to analyze and understand the code snippets. You can also run them on your local machine. Each snippet has a comment so it's easier for you to understand what the code is doing. If still you don't get the code snippet, google about it or ask AI (perks of living in AI era lol).

## Track your learning

To stay organized and use your time efficiently, track your learning. Also consider [golang roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/golang). It provides you with a decent roadmap and an ability to track your progress. Upon completion of this guide, you can move on to more specialized area of Go like a career as a Backend developer or streamlining your devops work.
